Enter the `examples` folder and run the examples from a terminal. For instance:

```bash
sh create_exec.sh ex1.f90
```

On Windows, use:

```cmd
create_exec.bat ex1.f90
```

Alternatively, you can compile and execute the source files manually.

The examples in the `SourcesF` folder can be compiled directly.
Using the Intel Fortran compiler (`ifx`) is recommended. For example:

```bash
ifx ex3.f90
```
